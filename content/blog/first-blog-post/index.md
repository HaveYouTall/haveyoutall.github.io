Welcome to my blog! This is an example blog post that demonstrates how to create content for your academic website.

## Introduction

This post shows how you can easily add new blog entries to your website. Each blog post supports:

- **Markdown formatting** for rich text content
- **Images** that are automatically optimized
- **Tags** for categorization
- **Code snippets** with syntax highlighting
- **Mathematical equations** using LaTeX

## Adding Images

You can add images by placing them in the same folder as your blog post's `index.md` file. For example:

![Example Image](featured.png)

## Code Examples

Here's a code snippet with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Success"
```

## Mathematical Equations

You can include mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax:

$$E = mc^2$$

## Conclusion

This is just a sample blog post. You can replace this content with your own thoughts, research updates, tutorials, or any other content you'd like to share.

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new folder in `content/blog/your-post-name/`
2. Add an `index.md` file with your content
3. Optionally add images like `featured.png`
4. Update the front matter with your title, date, tags, etc.
